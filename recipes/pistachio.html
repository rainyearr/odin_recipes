    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup mascarpone cheese, divided</li>
      <li>1/4 cup white sugar</li>
      <li>1/4 cup brown sugar</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons melted butter</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon salt, divided</li>
      <li>1 (17.3 ounce) package puff pastry, thawed</li>
      <li>
        1/2 cup finely chopped pistachios, plus more for garnish if desired
      </li>
      <li>3/4 cup pistachio cream, divided</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons heavy cream</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Step 1: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking
        sheet with parchment or grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Step 2: Combine 1/2 cup mascarpone, white sugar, brown sugar, cinnamon,
        melted butter, and 1/8 teaspoon salt in a bowl and mix until smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Step 3: Roll pastry sheets out on a lightly floured surface. Divide
        sugar mixture among the 2 sheets and spread into a thin layer going
        almost to the edges. Sprinkle each sheet evenly with chopped pistachios
        and drizzle each with 2 tablespoons pistachio cream.
      </li>
      <li>
        Step 4: Roll each sheet into a log and place seam side down on the
        cutting board. Use a sharp knife to cut each log into 6 pinwheels. Place
        cinnamon rolls, cut side up, into the prepared pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Step 5: Bake in the preheated oven until lightly golden brown, 20 to 25
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Step 6: Meanwhile, add remaining mascarpone, pistachio cream, heavy
        cream, and salt to a bowl and beat with an electric mixer until smooth.
        Gradually add powdered sugar and beat until smooth and slightly fluffy.
        Spread frosting over warm cinnamon rolls and sprinkle with additional
        chopped pistachios if desired.
      </li>
    </ol>
